# Version 2.0

This is a major overhaul of the script, with the goal of making it more balanced. In play-testing, good was winning too many games too easily because of the lack of evil droison and lack of need to distrust their own info. This update removes most of the old minions, an re-works the outsiders

## Townsfolk Changes

- Removed Gambler, added Dreamer
  - The Dreamer is a necessary increase to town's power given the evil/outsider updates. It can still serve a similar purpose to the Gambler (e.g. finding a heretic/evil player, confirming a good player), but without the cost of death
- Removed Engineer
  - In play-testing, the Engineer almost always created a Yagababble, causing a night of no deaths and virtually confirming themselves. This eventually snowballed into lack of outsider secrecy and just much easier worlds for the good team to solve
- Added Mathematician
  - With the increase of droison, the Mathematician can really help some important solves

## Outsider Changes

- Removed Ogre
- Removed Puzzlemaster
- Added Drunk
- Added Plague Doctor

With these changes, none of the outsiders will tell the truth immediately. During play-testing, the puzzlemaster would often tell the truth immediately which caused issues. Additionally, with no puzzlemaster in play, the good team could mostly trust their info. The Drunk adds a more exciting dynamic here

## Minion Changes

- Removed Cerenovus
- Removed Goblin
- Removed Psychopath
- Added Poisoner
- Added Marionette

This is the biggest change to the script, as the "loud minions" theme no longer really applies (I may even remove Organ Grinder in the future). The evil team needed more tools at their disposal to get town to distrust their info, and poisoner/marionette are perfect for that, while the good team can still fight back with tools like the acrobat, dreamer, and mathematician

## Demon Changes

- Added Pukka

The Pukka is an interesting addition here. Not only does it add some more evil poisoning, but it can also be an interesting explanation for 0 deaths in the night if the Pukka poisoned player is executed. The good team also has a lot of tools at their disposal for figuring out if it is a pukka game or not, such as the Banshee and acrobat

# Version 1.5

- Removed Zombuul, add Scarlet Woman

Zombuul has proven that it does not quite fit on this script. There are not enough ways to give the Zombuul kill agency. The Scarlet Woman helps on the script in two main ways

1. It serves a similar purpose to Zombuul in terms of prolonging games where town thinks they've killed the demon
2. It disallows more scenarios where the evil team can gamble on there being a Heretic and try to immediately win the game

# Version 1.4

- Initial release of the script, with the previous 4 patches already applied
