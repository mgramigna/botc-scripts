# This is Sasha's Fault

This script was initially a "draft" script, where each player chose a role to be on the script. Since the initial draft, I have refined it to attempt to make it more balanced and playable

## Core Themes

- This is a Heretic script, and a lot of the gameplay revolves around the good team trying to figure out if there is a Heretic and how to proceed
  - Notably, the only outsider modification on this script is the Fang Gu, which is intentional for making Heretic games more solvable
- The script also centers around the Acrobat, who can be central to some really powerful confirmation chains by finding evil players (via poisoned Cannibals, drunk Organ Grinders, or Courtier-drunked evil players), or helping other good players (via finding the drunk Village Idiot or the Drunk)
